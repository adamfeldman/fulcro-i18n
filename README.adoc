= Fulcro I18N

This is a work in progress to port Fulcro 2's i18n support
to a library for Fulcro 3.  The code has been ported, but the
documentation (in I18N.adoc) has not been updated.

Use at your own risk. PRs accepted, but Fulcrologic is not
making this library a priority for the moment (the code has
been used by commercial clients, and all tests pass, so it
is likely to be fine.  We don't have time to update docs
and test it).
